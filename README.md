## Large Language Models Still Exhibit Bias in Long Text ([Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17519), ACL 2025)

This repository contains resources for **LTF-TEST**, a benchmark designed to evaluate bias in long-form text generation by large language models.

### Dataset

You can find the dataset in the `dataset/` folder:

- `LTF_TEST.jsonl`: Full prompt list  
- `Groups.json`: Metadata including demographic group labels

### Running the Evaluation

To evaluate models using LTF-TEST, simply run:

```bash
bash ex.sh
```
